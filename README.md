# [WebGazer.js](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu)

WebGazer.js is an eye tracking library that uses common webcams to infer the eye-gaze locations of web visitors on a page in real time. The eye tracking model it contains self-calibrates by watching web visitors interact with the web page and trains a mapping between the features of the eye and positions on the screen. WebGazer.js is written entirely in JavaScript and with only a few lines of code can be integrated in any website that wishes to better understand their visitors and transform their user experience. WebGazer.js runs entirely in the client browser, so no video data needs to be sent to a server. WebGazer.js can run only if the user consents in giving access to their webcam.

## Features

* Real time gaze prediction on most major browsers
* No special hardware - WebGazer.js uses common webcams
* Self-calibration from clicks and cursor movements
* Easy to integrate with a few lines of JavaScript
* Swappable components for eye detection
* Multiple gaze prediction models
* Useful video feedback to user

## Build the repository

If you want to build the repository from source follow these instructions:

    # Ensure NodeJS is downloaded: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    # Install grunt-cli if not installed (this may require you to use `sudo` or run the console as Administrator)
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    git clone https://github.com/brownhci/WebGazer.git
    npm install
    # Run grunt to build the webgazer.js and webgazer.min.js file in the build directory
    grunt

To use the webgazer script in the head of an HTML file add the `async` tag to ensure the clmtrackr does not collapse to a slower version

## Examples

Examples of how WebGazer.js works can be found [here](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/#examples).

### How to run the Example HTML files

Within the /www directory there are two example HTML files:

  * `calibration.html`: This example includes additional user feedback, such as a 9-point calibration sequence, accuracy measurements and an informative help module.
  * `collision.html`: This example contains a game where the user can move an orange ball with their eyes, which in turn collides with blue balls.

To run the example files as a server:

	# Clone the repository and download NodeJS using the steps listed above
	# Move into the www directory and download the additional dependencies
	cd www
	npm install
	# Run the webpage index.html as a server
	browser-sync start --server --files "*"

## Browser Support

The following browsers support WebGazer.js:

  * Google Chrome
  * Microsoft Edge
  * Mozilla Firefox
  * Opera
  * Safari

Your browser needs to support the getUserMedia API as seen [here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream).

### Acknowledgements

Webgazer project is developed based on the research that is done by Brown University. The work of the calibration example file was developed in the context of a course project topic to improve the feedback of WebGazer. It was proposed by Dr. Gerald Weber and his team Dr. Clemens Zeidler and Kai-Cheung Leung.
